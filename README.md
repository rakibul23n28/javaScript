# Blogify & Short URL Projects

## Overview

These projects were built as part of my learning journey in mastering JavaScript full-stack development. The goal was to gain hands-on experience with modern web development tools and practices by building real-world applications.

### Blogify

Blogify is a full-featured blogging platform where users can create, edit, and delete blogs. It supports user authentication and authorization, real-time commenting, and other advanced functionalities. The project was designed to implement both backend and frontend technologies in a cohesive manner.

#### Key Features:
1. **User Authentication and Authorization:** 
   - Secure login and registration system with role-based access control.

2. **Blog Management:**
   - Front page with a list of blogs.
   - Add new blog posts.
   - View blog details.
   - Edit and delete blogs.

3. **Real-time Features:**
   - Socket.io integration for real-time comments.
   - Socket.io integration for real-time likes.

4. **Search and Filtering:**
   - Search functionality to easily find blogs.
   - Tagging system with admin-only tag creation and user tagging during blog creation.

5. **Image Uploads:**
   - Frontend and backend integration for uploading and displaying images using Summernote.

6. **Analytics:**
   - Time spent on the page analytics for user interaction analysis.

### Short URL Project

This project is a URL shortening service that allows users to create shortened URLs for easier sharing and tracking. The project focuses on understanding URL redirection and building a simple but efficient backend service.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose (MongoDB)
- **Real-time:** Socket.io
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Image Handling:** Summernote, Multer (for backend image uploads)
- **Analytics:** Custom time-spent tracking implementation

## Learnings and Future Goals

Through these projects, I deepened my understanding of full-stack JavaScript development, including RESTful API design, real-time communication with WebSockets, and secure authentication mechanisms. I've also applied various best practices for code organization, security, and user experience design.

While I have completed these projects, I recognize that there is always more to learn. I will now be shifting my focus to more advanced projects, aiming to implement best practices, scalability, and optimization in all aspects of the development process.

Stay tuned for more updates!
